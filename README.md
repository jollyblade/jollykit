# ChunkProcessor
Use case example: having large datasets loading them at once can use up all the memory, so it just takes a list of ids, referring to the data, splits
the list to smaller chunks, loads the data using the chunks, and processes them, after that aggregates the counts.

The current package is called com.daftbyte, links to this site: daftbyte.com, this is also my own website. Will be uploaded with content soon, articles, etc, linking back to this github site.
